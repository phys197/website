			<p>We have entered the age of large surveys, with many countries fielding space- and ground-based instruments that can robotically photograph all of the sky that is visible to them every night. What is left for astronomer's at a small college like Saint Mary's to do?</p>
			<p>The surprising answer is: <em>more than ever</em>.</p>
			<p>This is partly because every survey has limitations, whether that be cadence, saturation, duration, spectoscopy or resolution. Far from exhausting the observational space, the large surveys are cutting swaths in what remains a massive space.  In doing so, the large surveys are multiplying &mdash; by 10x or 100x &mdash; the number of targets that smaller telescopes are being asked to study.</p>
			<p>Thanks to the vision of Prof. Ron Olowin, to a generous gift in memory of Norma Geissberger, and to ongoing internal commitment, Saint Mary's already has the equipment to complement the work of the large surveys. Our equipment can do this by quantitatively measuring subtle changes in the brightness of stars.</p>
			<p>Historically, such measurements were used to establish cosmic distance scales and expansion, including the discovery in 1924 that our galaxy, the grouping of stars we call the Milky Way, was just one of many, and the discovery in 1929 that the universe is expanding.</p>
			<p>Today similar techniques applied to much smaller brightness changes are being used to rapidly expand the catalog of planets found around other stars. The demographics of these systems &mdash; especially the size and orbital period &mdash; are informing theories of our solar system's formation, about which important facts still remain unknown or contradictory.</p>
			<p>As that catalog grows a small subset of stars known as "dippers" whose planetary systems are still in formation are being identified. Just as the Earth crosses the face of the Sun each year when viewed from Jupiter, clouds of proto-planetary material cross the face of other stars. By studying these brightness curves, the structure of the proto-planetary disks can be computed and their evolution can be modeled. For more information about exoplanets and dippers, see <a href="resources/AAVSO_Keynote_2016Rodriguez.pdf">the keynote by Dr. Joseph Rodriguez</a> of Harvard's Center for Astrophysics, given at this year's annual meeting of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO).</p>
			<p>For decades, networks of astronomers with smaller telescopes, of which the AAVSO is the best-known, have been collectively following the most interesting targets they can mutually identify. The network is ready-made and welcoming of participation by modest but serious individuals and small teams. It is well within our reach to understand, operate and calibrate our equipment so that it is meaningfully contributing to the large-scale surveys and their follow-up networks, and that is what we have set out to do.</p>

			<p>A telescope is merely the centerpiece of a working astrophysical observing system. Although eyepieces are stil attached to them to do sanity checks on alignment, the actual business end of a telescope is not its objective, but its camera, also known as a charge-coupled device or CCD. The CCD is much like the sensor in an ordinary digital camera, except that it has a very small refrigerator attached to it to reduce stray thermal excitations of its pixels, and thereby to better allow tiny amounts of starlight to stand out.</p>
			<p>Just as an ordinary camera has distortions and imperfections, the telescope and its digital camera have distortions and imperfections that must be corrected for. The atmosphere itself varies from night to night and even from position to position in the sky, creating more corrections that must be accounted for lest they be mistaken for the small variations in star brightness that are the signals we are looking for.</p>
			<p>The field is called CCD photometry and it is sufficiently well-established that we should readily be able to follow the standard methods for measuring the distortions and imperfections and accounting for them. It helps that we have the same high-quality cameras, filters and focusers that many other groups are using, and that we have sufficient computer and software expertise that we can use the very same packages (AstroImageJ and astro.py) to analyze our CCD data that astronomers at the largest observatories use.</p>
