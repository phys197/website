			<p>We have entered the age of large surveys, with many countries fielding space- and ground-based instruments that can robotically photograph all of the sky that is visible to them every night. What is left for astronomers at a small college like Saint Mary's to do?</p>
			<p>The surprising answer is: <em>more than ever</em>.</p>
			<p>This is partly because every survey has limitations, whether that be cadence, saturation, duration, spectroscopy or resolution. Far from exhausting the observational space, the large surveys are only cutting swaths in what remains a wide-open field for the foreseeable future.  In doing so, the large surveys are multiplying &mdash; by 10x or 100x &mdash; the number of targets that smaller telescopes are being asked to study.</p>
			<p>Thanks to the vision of Prof. Ron Olowin, to a generous gift in memory of Norma Geissberger, and to ongoing School of Science and Departmental commitment, Saint Mary's already has the equipment to complement the work of the large surveys. Our equipment can do this by quantitatively measuring subtle changes in the brightness of stars.</p>
			<p>Historically, such measurements were used to establish cosmic distance scales and expansion, including the discovery in 1924 that our galaxy &mdash; the grouping of stars we call the Milky Way &mdash; was just one of many, and the discovery in 1929 that the universe is expanding.</p>
			<p>Today, similar techniques applied to much smaller brightness changes are being used to rapidly expand the catalog of planets found around other stars. The demographics of these systems &mdash; especially the planetary sizes and orbital periods &mdash; are informing theories of our own solar system's formation, about which important facts still remain unknown or contradictory.</p>
			<p>As the exoplanet catalog grows, a small subset of stars known as "dippers" whose planetary systems are still in formation are being identified. Just as the Earth regularly crosses the face of the Sun when viewed from Jupiter, clouds of proto-planetary material cross the face of other stars. By studying the resulting brightness curves, the structure of the proto-planetary disks can be computed and their evolution can be modeled. For more information about exoplanets and dippers, see <a href="resources/AAVSO_Keynote_2016Rodriguez.pdf">the keynote by Dr. Joseph Rodriguez</a> of Harvard's Center for Astrophysics, given at this year's annual meeting of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO).</p>
			<p>For decades, networks of astronomers with smaller telescopes, of which the AAVSO is the best-known, have been collectively following the most interesting targets they can mutually identify. The network is ready-made and welcoming of participation by modest but serious individuals and small teams. It is well within our reach to understand, operate and calibrate our equipment so that it is meaningfully contributing to the large-scale surveys and their follow-up networks, and that is what we have set out to do.</p>

			<p>A telescope is merely the centerpiece of a working astrophysical observing system. Although eyepieces are still attached to them for enjoyment and to do sanity checks on alignment, the actual business end of a telescope is its camera, also known as a charge-coupled device or CCD. The CCD is much like the sensor in an ordinary digital camera, except that it has a very small refrigerator attached to it to reduce stray thermal excitations of its pixels, and thereby to better allow tiny amounts of starlight to stand out.</p>
			<p>Just as an ordinary camera has distortions and imperfections, the telescope and its digital camera have distortions and imperfections that must be corrected for. Even the atmosphere itself varies from night to night and from position to position in the sky, creating more corrections that must be accounted for lest they be mistaken for the small variations in star brightness that are the signals we are looking for.</p>
			<p>The field of aquiring and correcting CCD data is called CCD photometry, and it is sufficiently well-established that we should readily be able to follow its methods. It helps that we have the same high-quality cameras, filters and focusers that many other groups are using, and that we have sufficient computer and software expertise that we can use the very same packages to analyze our CCD data &mdash; AstroImageJ and astro.py &mdash; that astronomers at the largest observatories use.</p>
			<p>To rapidly come up to speed, we will follow standard references on the subject, including:</p>

			<h6 class="docs-header">Equipment</h6>
			<p>The Geissberger Observatory is a capable research instrument, and if necessary, we will proceed directly to using it. However, just as one would do well to spend some time sailing a dinghy before taking out a yacht, it is highly advisable to completely understand the subsystems we will be deploying in a more convenient and forgiving setting.</p>
			<p>While inventorying the College's equipment, we have identified two 7&Prime; Maksutov-Cassegrain telescopes, currently unused. Neither of these has an equatorial mount, which is a prerequisite for astrophotography.</p>
			<p>Our first order of business will be to enable these small scopes to take CCD data, provided that a proposal to obtain a mount is approved.</p>
			<p>Ideally, the mount should be of the same type as the Paramount ME II that the Geissberger rides on. This minimizes hardware incompatibilities, but more importantly, it minimizes the extended software learning curve. Lest this be underestimated, we should note that the software for running a telescope is separate from the software for analyzing CCD image data, and it consists of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Planetarium-Like Software</li>
				<li>Pointing/Guiding Software</li>
				<li>Automated Focusing, Filter Control, and Camera Control Software</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The software that the Geissberger uses for these three functions are TheSkyX Professional, TPoint, and the associated Camera Add-On, respectively. We are proposing that the smaller Maksutov-Cassegrains ride a Paramount MyT and use this very same software. A major plus of these packages is that unlike the packages used to run many small telescopes, they are cross-platform. This frees us to run on the Mac (or Linux/Unix) platforms that professional astronomers often use and that the Department has standardized on in its laboratories.</p>
			<p>The Geissberger has a Van Slyke Engineering focuser whose functionality we do not plan to duplicate on the smaller telescopes.</p>
			<p>The remaining equipment, which can be attached to any of these telescopes, consists of Santa Barbara Instrument Group (SBIG) and Orion cameras and an SBIG filter wheel.<p>
			<p>It may be necessary to replace or add to our set of filters. Other equipment unknowns are that our storage facilities have not been adequate. The "pad" near the Geissberger has been penetrated by mice, and this, time and dampness may cause some unpleasant suprises as we start actively using the equipment that was stored there. That said, by far the largest investments have already been and/or will be completed once we have purchased another equatorial mount.</p>
			<p>Finally, lest one be paralyzed by unkowns in the decision tree, it is important to note that were we to encounter equipment problems with one configuration, it is highly advantageous that we have other configurations to fall back on.</p>

			<h6 class="docs-header">Results</h6>
			<p>Per the objectives and evaluation criteria in the aforementioned syllabus, we have two major goals, one operational and one scientific:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Our operational goal is simply to be able to systematically and regularly collect data using both our Maksutov-Cassegrain telescopes and the Geissberger. (Note: we are not proposing to use both the Maksutov-Cassegrains simultaneously, and therefore they can share a mount.) We will produce manuals covering at least two telescope configurations so that other members of the Saint Mary's community can more rapidly follow our footsteps. The target audience for the manuals is a physics faculty member or a physics senior.</li>
				<li>Our principal scientific goal is to have light curve data on one or more dipper stars accepted into the AAVSO database and to have a poster session prepared in time for the joint AAVSO and Society for Astronomical Sciences (SAS) meeting in June, 2017 meeting in Ontario, California.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additional operational and scientific goals are discussed in the <a href="resources/IndependentStudyPetition-2016-11-10.pdf">syllabus</a>. Please keep in mind, that if we knew exactly what we were doing and what our results would be, it wouldn't be research. For that reason, it is impossible at this time to more precisely state what our likely results will be.</p>
